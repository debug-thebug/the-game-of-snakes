# the-game-of-snakes
A classic game of Snakes! Made completely in C++, for Windows. Enjoy!

Here are some screenshots of the game. There are 4 levels, each level changes the speed of our snake. Let the games begin!

Currently the game supports a window of fix width only. Will work in future to make it dynamic! Hope you guys enjoy the game.
